The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq \\nfinished with gains of 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively, largely thanks to a \\nlate rally that left the two indices at their best marks of the day. \\nMeanwhile, the Dow lost 0.3%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped \\n1.7%.</p><p>President Trump\\'s decision to impose tariffs on steel and \\naluminum imports, which was announced on Thursday, prompted threats of \\nretaliation from leaders around the globe and sent stocks lower in Asia \\nand Europe overnight. Wall Street joined the global sell off at the \\nopening bell, with the S&amp;P 500 quickly dropping 1.0%, but the market\\n started to regain its footing about an hour into the session. By \\nmidday, the S&amp;P 500 had climbed all the way back to its unchanged \\nmark.</p><p>The outperformance of the heavily-weighted health care \\n(+1.0%) and technology (+1.0%) sectors, which represent around 40.0% of \\nthe broader market combined, helped lift the benchmark index. Within the\\n health care group, biotechnology shares showed particular strength, \\nevidenced by the 2.4% increase in the <strong>iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF</strong>\\n (IBB 109.65, +2.61). Meanwhile, chipmakers were among the top \\nperformers in the tech space, pushing the PHLX Semiconductor Index \\nhigher by 1.8%.</p><p>In total, seven of eleven S&amp;P 500 sectors \\nfinished in the green. Health care and technology were the best \\nperformers, while real estate (-0.4%) was the worst.</p><p>The latest batch of fourth quarter earnings included several retail names, including <strong>Gap</strong> (GPS 34.18, +2.48, +7.8%),<strong> Nordstrom</strong> (JWN 53.04, +2.93, +5.9%), <strong>Foot Locker</strong> (FL 40.04, -5.84, -12.7%), and <strong>J.C. Penney</strong>\\n (JCP 3.71, -0.21, -5.4%). The results were mostly better than expected \\n(GPS, FL, and JCP all beat earnings estimates, while JWN missed). </p><p>Meanwhile, Dow component <strong>McDonald\\'s</strong>\\n (MCD 148.27, -7.43) dropped 4.8%, hitting its lowest level in more than\\n nine months, after RBC Capital Markets trimmed its target price for MCD\\n shares to $170 from $190,&nbsp;citing a disappointing launch for the \\nfast food giant\\'s $1, $2, $3 menu.</p><p>Elsewhere, U.S. Treasuries gave\\n back most of their Thursday advance on Friday, pushing yields higher \\nacross the curve; the benchmark 10-yr yield jumped five basis points to \\n2.86%. The 10-yr yield finished the week lower by one basis point and \\nnine basis points below the four-year high it hit on February 21.</p><p>In\\n currencies, the yen advanced 0.5% against the U.S. dollar to 105.72, \\nwhich is its best level since November 2016, after Bank of Japan \\nGovernor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BoJ would consider exiting from its \\naggressive monetary easing as early as 2019. Meanwhile, the euro jumped \\n0.5% against the greenback to 1.2329.</p><p>Friday\\'s economic data was limited to the final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for February: </p><ul><li>The\\n final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index \\nfor February dipped to 99.7 (Briefing.com consensus 99.5) from 99.9 in \\nthe preliminary reading. <ul><li>The key takeaway from the report is \\nthat consumer sentiment remains near multi-year highs with consumers \\nshowing little concern about the prospect of rising interest rates.</li></ul></li></ul><p>On Monday, investors will receive the ISM Services Index for February (Briefing.com consensus 58.8) at 10:00 AM ET.</p><ul><li>Nasdaq Composite: +5.1% YTD </li><li>S&amp;P 500: +0.7% YTD </li><li>Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.7% YTD </li><li>Russell 2000: -0.2% YTD</li></ul><p><em>Week In Review: Selling Resumes</em></p><p>Stocks\\n tumbled this week, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping 2.0%. The Nasdaq \\nComposite did a little better, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a\\n little worse, losing 1.1% and 3.1%, respectively. The small-cap Russell\\n 2000 showed relative strength, but still finished lower by 1.0%.</p><p>The\\n week actually began on a positive note, with the S&amp;P 500 jumping \\n1.2% on Monday, but took a turn for the worst on Tuesday when new Fed \\nChairman Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services \\nCommittee. Mr. Powell\\'s prepared remarks didn\\'t contain any surprises, \\ncalling for a continued path of gradual rate hikes. However, in the \\nQ&amp;A session, Mr. Powell noted that his economic projections have \\nincreased since the December FOMC meeting, prompting a negative reaction\\n on Wall Street due to concerns that the Fed may hike rates more than \\nexpected.</p><p>The Fed forecasted three rate hikes for 2018 at its \\nDecember meeting, but, in light of Mr. Powell\\'s upwardly revised growth \\nprojections, investors have increased their expectations for a fourth \\nhike. The CME FedWatch Tool places the chances of a fourth rate hike at \\n30.7%, up from 24.4% last week. The chances of a March rate hike are at \\n83.1%.</p><p>Fast-forwarding to Thursday, the equity market was dealt \\nanother blow, this time from President Trump, who announced that he\\'ll \\nbe imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports--25% for steel and 10%\\n for aluminum. Mr. Trump\\'s decision prompted concerns about higher \\nprices and retaliation from China and other trading partners.</p><p>However,\\n outside of fundamental factors affecting this week\\'s sell off, it\\'s \\nalso important to note that the S&amp;P 500 broke below its 50-day \\nmoving average, a key technical level that\\'s provided the market with \\nsupport since the 2016 presidential election. The benchmark index \\ndropped below its 50-day moving average for the first time in five \\nmonths during the big sell off at the beginning of February and has \\nticked back above it a few times since--most notably on Monday, when the\\n S&amp;P 500 hit a three-week high.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 initially \\nfound support at its 50-day moving average on Wednesday, but selling \\naccelerated after the index broke through the level on its second \\nattempt. If this week\\'s selling continues, investors will be looking for\\n other potential areas of support, including the S&amp;P 500\\'s February \\nlow (2581) and its 200-day moving average (2561).</p><p>11 of 11 S&amp;P\\n 500 sectors finished the week in negative territory, with industrials \\n(-3.3%) and materials (-4.0%) being the weakest performers. The \\ntechnology (-0.8%), consumer staples (-1.3%), and telecom services \\n(-0.7%) groups exhibited relative strength, but the remaining sectors \\nlost between 2.0% and 2.9%.</p><p>A slew of retailers reported earnings this week. <strong>TJX</strong>\\n (TJX) rallied 7.0% on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected \\nearnings and revenues for the fourth quarter and raising its profit \\nguidance. Conversely,<strong> Lowe\\'s</strong> (LOW) dropped 6.5% in the \\nsame session after missing Q4 earnings estimates and lowering its profit\\n guidance for fiscal year 2019.

The tariffs, which are 25% for steel imports and 10% \\nfor imported aluminum, prompted concerns about higher prices and a \\npotential retaliation from China and other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Steel names<strong> U.S. Steel</strong> (X 46.01, +2.50),&nbsp;<strong>AK Steel</strong> (AKS 5.65, +0.49), <strong>Nucor</strong> (NUE 67.53, +2.13), and <strong>Steel Dynamics</strong> (STLD 48.10, +1.85) outperformed following the news, adding between 3.3% and 9.5%, while aluminum producer <strong>Century Aluminum</strong> (CENX 20.48, +1.43) spiked 7.5%.</p><p>However, automakers reacted negatively to the tariffs, which will likely weigh on their profit margins. <strong>General Motors </strong>(GM 37.79, -1.56), <strong>Ford Motor</strong> (F 10.29, -0.32), and <strong>Fiat Chrysler </strong>(FCAU 20.59, -0.60) dropped between 2.8% and 4.0%, while <strong>Toyota Motor</strong> (TM 130.39, -4.21) and <strong>Honda Motor</strong>\\n (HMC 35.12, -0.97) lost 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively. Automakers also \\nreported U.S. sales for February on Thursday, which, for the most part, \\ndeclined year over year.</p><p>Looking at the broader market, 11 of 11 \\nS&amp;P 500 sectors finished Thursday in negative territory, with six \\nsettling with losses of at least 1.0%. The heavily-weighted financials \\n(-1.9%), industrials (-1.9%), technology (-1.7%), and health care \\n(-1.6%) sectors, which represent around 65.0% of the broader market \\ncombined, were the weakest performers. Conversely, the energy (-0.2%), \\nutilities (-0.1%), and telecom services (-0.3%) sectors held up \\nrelatively well.</p><p>Stocks bounced back a bit in the final hour of \\ntrading, leaving the major averages a ways above their worst marks of \\nthe day; at their session lows, the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq, and the Dow\\n held losses between 2.0% and 2.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 showed \\nrelative strength on Thursday, losing just 0.3%.</p><p>In Washington, \\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell wrapped up his first semiannual monetary \\npolicy testimony on Thursday with an appearance before the Senate \\nBanking Committee, but he didn\\'t really provide investors with any new \\ninformation. The market still projects three rate hikes for 2018, but a \\nfourth hike is certainly on the table; according to the CME FedWatch \\nTool, the chances of a fourth hike currently sit at 28.1%, down slightly\\n from 31.9% on Wednesday.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury market recorded its \\nsecond consecutive day of gains on Thursday, pushing yields lower across\\n the curve. The yield on the benchmark 10-yr note dropped seven basis \\npoints to 2.80%, which puts it 15 basis points below the four-year high \\nit touched last week. Meanwhile, the 2-yr yield dropped six basis points\\n to 2.20%.</p><p>In currencies, the U.S. Dollar Index retreated from a six-week high, dropping 0.4% to 90.22.</p><p>Reviewing\\n Thursday\\'s economic data, which included Personal Income and Spending \\nfor January, the PCE Price Index and the core PCE Price Index for \\nJanuary, weekly Initial Claims, the ISM Index for February, and \\nConstruction Spending for January:</p><ul><li>Personal income climbed \\n0.4% in January (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an unrevised \\nincrease of 0.4% in December.
