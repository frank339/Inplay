  <tr>
    <td><br></td>
    <td class="st-Art"><p>Wall Street finished a disappointing week with
 a mostly positive outing on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 
finished with gains of 0.5% and 1.1%, respectively, largely thanks to a 
late rally that left the two indices at their best marks of the day. 
Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.3%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 jumped 
1.7%.</p><p>President Trump's decision to impose tariffs on steel and 
aluminum imports, which was announced on Thursday, prompted threats of 
retaliation from leaders around the globe and sent stocks lower in Asia 
and Europe overnight. Wall Street joined the global sell off at the 
opening bell, with the S&amp;P 500 quickly dropping 1.0%, but the market
 started to regain its footing about an hour into the session. By 
midday, the S&amp;P 500 had climbed all the way back to its unchanged 
mark.</p><p>The outperformance of the heavily-weighted health care 
(+1.0%) and technology (+1.0%) sectors, which represent around 40.0% of 
the broader market combined, helped lift the benchmark index. Within the
 health care group, biotechnology shares showed particular strength, 
evidenced by the 2.4% increase in the <strong>iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF</strong>
 (IBB 109.65, +2.61). Meanwhile, chipmakers were among the top 
performers in the tech space, pushing the PHLX Semiconductor Index 
higher by 1.8%.</p><p>In total, seven of eleven S&amp;P 500 sectors 
finished in the green. Health care and technology were the best 
performers, while real estate (-0.4%) was the worst.</p><p>The latest batch of fourth quarter earnings included several retail names, including <strong>Gap</strong> (GPS 34.18, +2.48, +7.8%),<strong> Nordstrom</strong> (JWN 53.04, +2.93, +5.9%), <strong>Foot Locker</strong> (FL 40.04, -5.84, -12.7%), and <strong>J.C. Penney</strong>
 (JCP 3.71, -0.21, -5.4%). The results were mostly better than expected 
(GPS, FL, and JCP all beat earnings estimates, while JWN missed). </p><p>Meanwhile, Dow component <strong>McDonald's</strong>
 (MCD 148.27, -7.43) dropped 4.8%, hitting its lowest level in more than
 nine months, after RBC Capital Markets trimmed its target price for MCD
 shares to $170 from $190,&nbsp;citing a disappointing launch for the 
fast food giant's $1, $2, $3 menu.</p><p>Elsewhere, U.S. Treasuries gave
 back most of their Thursday advance on Friday, pushing yields higher 
across the curve; the benchmark 10-yr yield jumped five basis points to 
2.86%. The 10-yr yield finished the week lower by one basis point and 
nine basis points below the four-year high it hit on February 21.</p><p>In
 currencies, the yen advanced 0.5% against the U.S. dollar to 105.72, 
which is its best level since November 2016, after Bank of Japan 
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BoJ would consider exiting from its 
aggressive monetary easing as early as 2019. Meanwhile, the euro jumped 
0.5% against the greenback to 1.2329.</p><p>Friday's economic data was limited to the final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for February: </p><ul><li>The
 final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index 
for February dipped to 99.7 (Briefing.com consensus 99.5) from 99.9 in 
the preliminary reading. <ul><li>The key takeaway from the report is 
that consumer sentiment remains near multi-year highs with consumers 
showing little concern about the prospect of rising interest rates.</li></ul></li></ul><p>On Monday, investors will receive the ISM Services Index for February (Briefing.com consensus 58.8) at 10:00 AM ET.</p><ul><li>Nasdaq Composite: +5.1% YTD </li><li>S&amp;P 500: +0.7% YTD </li><li>Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.7% YTD </li><li>Russell 2000: -0.2% YTD</li></ul><p><em>Week In Review: Selling Resumes</em></p><p>Stocks
 tumbled this week, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping 2.0%. The Nasdaq 
Composite did a little better, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average did a
 little worse, losing 1.1% and 3.1%, respectively. The small-cap Russell
 2000 showed relative strength, but still finished lower by 1.0%.</p><p>The
 week actually began on a positive note, with the S&amp;P 500 jumping 
1.2% on Monday, but took a turn for the worst on Tuesday when new Fed 
Chairman Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services 
Committee. Mr. Powell's prepared remarks didn't contain any surprises, 
calling for a continued path of gradual rate hikes. However, in the 
Q&amp;A session, Mr. Powell noted that his economic projections have 
increased since the December FOMC meeting, prompting a negative reaction
 on Wall Street due to concerns that the Fed may hike rates more than 
expected.</p><p>The Fed forecasted three rate hikes for 2018 at its 
December meeting, but, in light of Mr. Powell's upwardly revised growth 
projections, investors have increased their expectations for a fourth 
hike. The CME FedWatch Tool places the chances of a fourth rate hike at 
30.7%, up from 24.4% last week. The chances of a March rate hike are at 
83.1%.</p><p>Fast-forwarding to Thursday, the equity market was dealt 
another blow, this time from President Trump, who announced that he'll 
be imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports--25% for steel and 10%
 for aluminum. Mr. Trump's decision prompted concerns about higher 
prices and retaliation from China and other trading partners.</p><p>However,
 outside of fundamental factors affecting this week's sell off, it's 
also important to note that the S&amp;P 500 broke below its 50-day 
moving average, a key technical level that's provided the market with 
support since the 2016 presidential election. The benchmark index 
dropped below its 50-day moving average for the first time in five 
months during the big sell off at the beginning of February and has 
ticked back above it a few times since--most notably on Monday, when the
 S&amp;P 500 hit a three-week high.</p><p>The S&amp;P 500 initially 
found support at its 50-day moving average on Wednesday, but selling 
accelerated after the index broke through the level on its second 
attempt. If this week's selling continues, investors will be looking for
 other potential areas of support, including the S&amp;P 500's February 
low (2581) and its 200-day moving average (2561).</p><p>11 of 11 S&amp;P
 500 sectors finished the week in negative territory, with industrials 
(-3.3%) and materials (-4.0%) being the weakest performers. The 
technology (-0.8%), consumer staples (-1.3%), and telecom services 
(-0.7%) groups exhibited relative strength, but the remaining sectors 
lost between 2.0% and 2.9%.</p><p>A slew of retailers reported earnings this week. <strong>TJX</strong>
 (TJX) rallied 7.0% on Wednesday after reporting better-than-expected 
earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter and raising its profit 
guidance. Conversely,<strong> Lowe's</strong> (LOW) dropped 6.5% in the 
same session after missing Q4 earnings estimates and lowering its profit
 guidance for fiscal year 2019. The <strong>SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF</strong> (XRT) finished the week lower, but ahead of the broader market, losing 1.4%.</p><p>In other corporate news, <strong>Comcast</strong> (CMCSA) dropped 7.4% on Tuesday after&nbsp;upping a bid from <strong>21st Century Fox</strong> (FOXA) for a large stake in British broadcaster Sky.&nbsp;</p></td>

today as investors continue to digest President Trump's Thursday 
decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The S&amp;P 
500 is drifting a tick above its flat line this afternoon, while the 
tech-heavy Nasdaq sports a gain of 0.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average shows a loss of 0.4%.</p><p>The market opened in negative 
territory, with the S&amp;P 500 down about 1.0% at its low, but began 
trimming losses about an hour into the session. The early losses 
followed a sell off overseas as investors in Asia and Europe mulled the 
potential effects of Mr. Trump's tariffs--namely, how trade partners 
might retaliate. </p><p>Japan's Nikkei (-2.5%) led the retreat in Asia 
as the yen jumped 0.6% against the dollar to 105.60, its highest level 
since the U.S. presidential election. Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko 
Kuroda said the BoJ would consider ending ultra-loose monetary policy if
 inflation hits 2.0% around fiscal 2019--which is what the central bank 
is currently forecasting.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Europe, France's CAC (-2.4%) paced the slide as the euro climbed 0.4% against the dollar to 1.2309.</p><p>Seven
 of eleven S&amp;P 500 sectors are trading lower, with the 
lightly-weighted utilities (-0.6%) and real estate (-0.7%) spaces being 
the weakest groups. The consumer discretionary (-0.4%) and industrials 
(-0.3%) sectors are also relatively weak, while the heavily-weighted 
technology (+0.2%) and health care (+0.7%) sectors outperform.</p><p>Within the health care space, biotechnology names are particularly strong, evidenced by the<strong> iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF </strong>(IBB 109.02, +1.98), which is up 1.9%.</p><p>In corporate news, <strong>McDonald's </strong>(MCD
 148.87, -6.83) is down 4.4%, hovering at a nine-month low, 
after&nbsp;RBC Capital Markets lowered its target price for MCD shares 
to $170 from $190. Meanwhile, <strong>Gap</strong> (GPS 33.98, +2.27) 
has jumped 7.1% after reporting better-than-expected earnings and 
revenues for the fourth quarter and issuing upbeat profit guidance.</p><p>Elsewhere,
 U.S. Treasuries have given back most of yesterday's gains today,

    <td class="st-Art"><p>Stocks tumbled for the third day in a row on Thursday, with the major averages losing between 1.3% and 1.7%.</p><p>The
 market kept close to its flat line for the first half of Thursday's 
session as investors debated their next move following Wednesday's 
breaching of the S&amp;P 500's 50-day simple moving average. Stocks 
started slipping in the early afternoon, but began a decisive retreat 
not long after President Trump announced new tariffs on steel and 
aluminum imports. The tariffs, which are 25% for steel imports and 10% 
for imported aluminum, prompted concerns about higher prices and a 
potential retaliation from China and other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Steel names<strong> U.S. Steel</strong> (X 46.01, +2.50),&nbsp;<strong>AK Steel</strong> (AKS 5.65, +0.49), <strong>Nucor</strong> (NUE 67.53, +2.13), and <strong>Steel Dynamics</strong> (STLD 48.10, +1.85) outperformed following the news, adding between 3.3% and 9.5%, while aluminum producer <strong>Century Aluminum</strong> (CENX 20.48, +1.43) spiked 7.5%.</p><p>However, automakers reacted negatively to the tariffs, which will likely weigh on their profit margins. <strong>General Motors </strong>(GM 37.79, -1.56), <strong>Ford Motor</strong> (F 10.29, -0.32), and <strong>Fiat Chrysler </strong>(FCAU 20.59, -0.60) dropped between 2.8% and 4.0%, while <strong>Toyota Motor</strong> (TM 130.39, -4.21) and <strong>Honda Motor</strong>
 (HMC 35.12, -0.97) lost 3.1% and 2.7%, respectively. Automakers also 
reported U.S. sales for February on Thursday, which, for the most part, 
declined year over year.</p><p>Looking at the broader market, 11 of 11 
S&amp;P 500 sectors finished Thursday in negative territory, with six 
settling with losses of at least 1.0%. The heavily-weighted financials 
(-1.9%), industrials (-1.9%), technology (-1.7%), and health care 
(-1.6%) sectors, which represent around 65.0% of the broader market 
combined, were the weakest performers. Conversely, the energy (-0.2%), 
utilities (-0.1%), and telecom services (-0.3%) sectors held up 
relatively well.</p><p>Stocks bounced back a bit in the final hour of 
trading, leaving the major averages a ways above their worst marks of 
the day; at their session lows, the S&amp;P 500, the Nasdaq, and the Dow
 held losses between 2.0% and 2.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 showed 
relative strength on Thursday, losing just 0.3%.</p><p>In Washington, 
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wrapped up his first semiannual monetary 
policy testimony on Thursday with an appearance before the Senate 
Banking Committee, but he didn't really provide investors with any new 
information. The market still projects three rate hikes for 2018, but a 
fourth hike is certainly on the table; according to the CME FedWatch 
Tool, the chances of a fourth hike currently sit at 28.1%, down slightly
 from 31.9% on Wednesday.</p><p>The U.S. Treasury market recorded its 
second consecutive day of gains on Thursday, pushing yields lower across
 the curve. The yield on the benchmark 10-yr note dropped seven basis 
points to 2.80%, which puts it 15 basis points below the four-year high 
it touched last week. Meanwhile, the 2-yr yield dropped six basis points
 to 2.20%.</p><p>In currencies, the U.S. Dollar Index retreated from a six-week high, dropping 0.4% to 90.22.</p><p>Reviewing
 Thursday's economic data, which included Personal Income and Spending 
for January, the PCE Price Index and the core PCE Price Index for 
January, weekly Initial Claims, the ISM Index for February, and 
Construction Spending for January:</p><ul><li>Personal income climbed 
0.4% in January (Briefing.com consensus +0.3%) following an unrevised 
increase of 0.4% in December. Meanwhile, personal spending rose 0.2% in 
January (Briefing.com consensus +0.2%) following an unrevised increase 
of 0.4% in December.</li><li>The PCE Price Index increased 0.4% in 
January (Briefing.com consensus +0.4%), while the core PCE Price Index, 
which excludes food and energy, increased 0.3% (Briefing.com consensus 
+0.3%). Year-over-year, the core PCE Price Index is up 1.5%, unchanged 
from the last two readings.<ul><li>The key takeaway from the report is 
that it won't shift the prevailing perspective that the Fed is expected 
to raise the fed funds rate at least three times this year.</li></ul></li><li>The
 latest weekly initial jobless claims count totaled 210,000, while the 
Briefing.com consensus expected a reading of 227,000. Today's tally was 
below the revised prior week count of 220,000 (from 222,000). As for 
continuing claims, they rose to 1.931 million from a revised count of 
1.874 million (from 1.875 million).<ul><li>The trend in initial claims, 
which held below 300,000 for the 156th straight week, will support the 
Fed's thinking that tight labor markets should ultimately invite a 
pickup in wage inflation.</li></ul></li><li>The ISM Index for February 
climbed to 60.8 from an unrevised reading of 59.1 in January, while the 
Briefing.com consensus expected a reading of 58.4.<ul><li>The key 
takeaway is that the Prices Index hit its highest level since May 2011. 
That will feed into fears about manufacturers passing through higher 
input costs to their customers, which will buttress inflation 
expectations.</li></ul></li><li>Construction Spending was flat in 
January (0.0%), while the Briefing.com consensus expected an increase of
 0.3%. The prior month's increase was raised to 0.8% from 0.7%.<ul><li>The
 key takeaway from the report is that construction spending growth 
continues to run at a relatively slow pace, which is an inhibitor of 
stronger overall growth.</li></ul></li></ul><p>On Friday, investors will
 receive the final reading of the University of Michigan Consumer 
Sentiment Index for February (Briefing.com consensus 99.5) at 10:00 AM 
ET.</p><ul><li>Nasdaq Composite: +4.0% YTD </li><li>S&amp;P 500: +0.2% YTD </li><li>Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.5% YTD </li><li>Russell 2000: -1.8% YTD</li></ul></td>

2017 granted early termination of the applicable waiting period under
